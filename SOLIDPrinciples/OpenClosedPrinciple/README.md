Open/Closed Principle suggests:
1. Open for extension, meaning that the classâ€™s behavior can be extended.
2. Closed for modification, meaning that the source code is set and cannot be changed.

Using inheritance or interfaces that allow polymorphic substitutions is a common way to comply with this principle.
